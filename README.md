# StarwarspeopleProject
This is my CLI project for Flatiron.

Its a Star Wars person informer. It'll tell you the characters name, height, mass, and gender, if they have one.
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'starwarspeople_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install starwarspeople_project

## Usage

Run the command './bin/starwarspeople
Type 'people' to get the list of characters
Type out characters name
Then type 'people' once again to bring up the list 
Then choose again

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
